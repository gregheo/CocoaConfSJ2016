Other resources:

* You can check out the slides on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/gregheo/scouting-swift-3) if you prefer browsing over there.
* I wrote a blog post about [escaping and non-escaping closures](https://swiftunboxed.com/lang/closures-escaping-noescape-swift3/) if you need a refresher.
